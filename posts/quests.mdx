## Quests Overview

Quests are missions given to players that allow them to pursue diverse storylines and do meaningful tasks offered by NPCs located around the Void. In return for doing quests, you will receive rewards such as [Void Matter](/void-matter), [experience points](/levels), and more. Some quests also unlock new areas, among other things. 

There is currently no way to check the status of quests unless you go back to the starting NPC.
