## Overview

Leveling is a core part of Voidpet; it allows you to evolve your Voidpet, unlock higher level quests, etc. When referring to `leveling`, we mean your combat level, not [bond level](/bond-and-skills). If you want to get straight to the level you need to evolve, [click here](#evolutions)

## Getting Experience Points

You can get experience points (XP) by doing [quests](/quests) and [attacking](/attacking) Voidpets. Based on anecdotal evidence, we've noticed that attacking higher-level Voidpets gives more XP, ignoring level matching. Level matching is a practice used to discourage low-level players from attacking high-level enemies (normally with friends) and getting enormous amounts of XP. 

### Multiple Voidpets

Assuming you can switch out Voidpets during battle, you'll probably be able to spread out XP from a victory between multiple Voidpets.

## Levels 

While the equation for leveling is currently unknown, you can level up your Voidpet with an exponentially increasing amount of XP. Levels currently are capped at 4. 

### Evolutions

Right now, you can evolve forms! You can view all the stages on [Voidpet tools](https://voidpet.io). Below is a table of when you evolve to the next stage Voidpet.

| Level | Stage It Evolves To |
| --- | --- |
| 4 | 2 |
