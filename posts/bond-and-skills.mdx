## What They are

### Bond

Bond is the connection you have with your Voidpet. Similar to your pets [level](/leveling), it's individual to each Voidpet. At bond level 3, your Voidpet has a chance to become a [vivid](/vivids). You can view the vivid your pet would have/may become [here](https://voidpet.io/)

There's also a theory that you may be able to change your Voidpet's name with a high enough bond. 

### Skills

Skills and stats are one and the same, each one corresponds to another of the opposite type.

*Direct is physical damage and energy is mental damage. [Pure damage](/pure-damage) doesn't seem to be able to be blocked* 

Here's how each skill interacts with the activity:

*Note that sleeping sets your skill to a random value.*

## Leveling Up Your Bond

You can level up your bond by doing activities. Navigate to your profile, then click `Play with <pet name>`. You get a small number of bond points for any activity and a larger amount if any of the stats are between 90 and 99 after playing. 

## Permanently Boost Your Stats

### Boosting a Stat Other than Health Points

*To boost health points, go [here](#boosting-health-points)*

1. First, figure out what skill you want to boost and what activities you want to boost it with [here](#skills)

2. Preform activities until your selected skill is between 90 and 99 and you should get a message like this:
![Stat higher](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/604167041427046424/957861546111959050/unknown.png)
Under the skills tab, that skill should now be higher than normal:
![Skill](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/939571914677043210/957860286621188167/unknown.png)

3. Battle low-level pets (like Minnie) and the stat will go higher. Note that losing a battle will make your boost go away and then you'll need to do the activities again!

4. Remove the boost (ex. do an activity) and the stat will now be permanently higher! 

### Boosting Health Points

1. Preform activities until your selected skills are at 100, and you'll get a message saying "Willpower Boosted"

2. Battle low-level pets (like Minnie) and your health will go up. Note that losing a battle will make your boost go away and then you'll need to do the activities again!

3. Remove the boost (ex. do an activity) and the stat will now be permanently higher!
