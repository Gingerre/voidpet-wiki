### Getting into the Game

Upon opening the game, you'll be asked for a passphrase, which is `nightmares`. You'll then be asked to log in with discord, which is the only way to athenticate at the moment. 

Although not required, you may join the Voidpet community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ukAQUkFBFF).

### Choosing a Pet

- You’re given a set of 3 voidpets to choose from: Sadness, Anger, and Anxious. There’s a fourth option, Envy, which you can choose by selecting the other three and pressing `I want neither of these`.

- There is a 10% chance of your voidpets being vivid. A vivid is this game’s equivalent to a shiny. You can learn more about the possible vivids [here](https://voidpet.io) and read more about vivids [here](/vivids).

- You're able to catch Voidpets in the actual game, but these are all the starter options.

- Preference is what your voidpet likes to do, indicated by the sentence `(your Voidpet) likes to do (x).`

- Chips are the small pin-like pictures that display the different traits of your voidpet. These can include simple things like height and weight, as 
well as game mechanic related traits such as Element and Chemistry

- When making a new voidpet, it is possible yours can obtain a personality trait. Your pet can earn a boost in bond points depending on the personality.
