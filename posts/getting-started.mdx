## Starting Out

### Getting into the Game

-First things first: nightmares is the passphrase

-You need your Discord in order to make an account on Voidpet

### Choosing a Pet

-You’re given a set of 3 voidpets to choose from: Sadness, Anger, and Anxious

- There’s a fourth option, Envy, which you can choose after going through the other three and selecting “I want neither of these”

-There is a 10% chance of your voidpets being vivid. A vivid is this game’s equivalent to a shiny. 
- Your voidpet will reveal whether or not it’s vivid by level 3
- There are 16 different types of vivids, each twice as rare as the last
- You cannot reset your voidpet account multiple times over to get a shiny

-You will be able to get more voidpets later but for now it's just you and your starter
