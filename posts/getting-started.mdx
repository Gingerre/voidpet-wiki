## Starting Out

### Getting into the Game

-First things first: nightmares is the passphrase

-You need your Discord in order to make an account on Voidpet

### Choosing a Pet

-You’re given a set of 3 voidpets to choose from: Sadness, Anger, and Anxious

- There’s a fourth option, Envy, which you can choose after going through the other three and selecting “I want neither of these”

-There is a 10% chance of your voidpets being vivid. A vivid is this game’s equivalent to a shiny. 
- Your voidpet will reveal whether or not it’s vivid by level 3
- There are 16 different types of vivids, each twice as rare as the last
- You cannot reset your voidpet account multiple times over to get a shiny

-You will be able to get more voidpets later but for now it's just you and your starter

### Character Customization

-When you open up your menu, click the explore button, its should prompt a small story and guide you to the character customization 

### Taking Care of Your Pet

#### Profile

-Your Pet’s Profile consists of 3 parts: Preference, Chips, and in some cases Personality

- Preference is what your voidpet likes to do, indicated by the sentence “(your Voidpet) likes to do (x).”

-Chips are the small pin-like pictures that display the different traits of your voidpet. These can include simple things like Height and Weight, as 
well as game mechanic related traits such as Element and Chemistry

-When making a new voidpet, it is possible yours can obtain a personality trait. Your pet can earn a boost in bond points depending on the personality.

#### Activities
-One way you can bond with your pet is through doing activities with them. 

-Doing any of the eight available activities will affect your voidpet’s hormonal stats. 

- Your Voidpet’s mood depends on the combinations of different hormonal levels.

-Playing with your pet can also raise their skill levels. They do not serve a purpose now but will be potentially important in future battle mechanics

#### Leveling up

-You can level up your pet once every 13 hours by playing with it. 

- Before a certain update it used to be until 12AM UTC passed. That is no longer true
