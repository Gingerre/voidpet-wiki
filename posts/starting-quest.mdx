## Stage 1

**You are ignored**

You try to call for help, but there is no noise. The Tilde turns around and floats away. The only one who can hear you is (insert Voidpet name here).

## Stage 2

**Voidpet whimpers at you**

Player: What should I do?

*Voidpet nods*

Player: Ok, I got this

*Voidpet takes a deep breath and unleashes a resounding bellow*

Voidpet: HEY YOU. Tilde. GET OVER HERE.

## Stage 3

Tilde: A wild Voidpet? 

Tilde: Angy, look over there! Let's catch it!

*The ghost-like Tilde rushes over to you, along with a plump, swaggering pet that seems intent on starting a fight.*

Tilde: Ugh, it's got a person with it.

*The Tilde groans and looks directly at you, even though you don't have a face or eyes.*

Tilde: Guess we should take them back to our school

Tilde: We have to finish our stupid recruitment quest for homework anyway, so we might as well

Tilde: Come with us.

*Angy speaks to your Voidpet in a reassuring, adult, human voice:*

Angy: Don't worry, we're just gonna enroll you in our school so you can actually learn how to survive out here.

*Sounds good. You haven't been able to do anything anyway, so you might as well accept help when it comes to your doorstep... Even if it's from someone with no manners...*

## Stage 4

*Your Voidpet notices that Angy is rather beeft and would refer not to take them in a fight...*

*Your Voidpet follows, and you start moving too, as if you are attached to your pet...*

Tilde: Alright, here we are. I'm going to take you to my counselor now

Tilde: Don't get in my way. I'm already behind in class, okay? So leave me alone and don't nag me for help

## Stage 5

Invidere: Hello, beautiful. And thank you, [Tilde](/tilde-npc), for bringing them here.

Invidere: My name is [Invidere](/invidere-npc), and I'm here to help young souls like you learn everything you need to survice in this wonderous place that we call The Void. 

*Invidere: What are your names* 

Player: Username and Voidpet name

Invidere: What lovely names. It's a pleasure to meet you both.

Invidere: Feels like a dream, doesn't it? The Void is a surreal, dangerous, and fascinating place. H
