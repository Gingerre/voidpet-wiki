## Contributing Guidelines

- All articles must be informative and based on ingame info rather than speculation. While some speculation is ok as the game is in an early stage, make sure it's clear to the reader that the content they're reading is speculation. Purely speculative articles won't be featured and may not be accepted.
- Please make sure you're covering a relevant topic. Many established wikis have pages for almost every topic you could think of, but while we're in this early stage, we don't need an article about a random NPC or item.
- Do **not** edit the main codebase. While you're free to make small edits to the homepage; `index.tsx`, don't mess with any other files that aren't in the `posts` directory. You may add more components as long as they're reusable
