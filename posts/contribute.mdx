Contributing is the core of what keeps this project alive. If you want to add an article, please make sure to follow the [contributing guidelines](#contributing-guidelines). Contributing requires no coding skills, if you can use the Discord message box you can help with this project. Learn how to below!

## How to contribute

Contributing is super easy! In four easy steps, you'll be able to contribute to the Voidpet wiki. 

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you don't already have one

2. Navigate to the page you want to edit on the main website. If you want to try on this article, scroll to the bottom and hit `Edit on Github`. Alternatively, if you want to create a new page, click [here](https://github.com/quick007/voidpet-wiki/tree/main/posts) and hit `add file`. 

3. Click the edit button (it looks like a pen, it's on the righthand side of the file info bar that contains the lines, file size, and a few other buttons). Editing is like using a souped-up version of the Discord Editor. Learn more [here](#learning-mdx). 

4. Hit `propose changes` you're ready to go ðŸŽ‰ We may follow up on your pull request (what we call proposals to change the website). 

## Learning MDX

The MDX editor is like a souped-up Discord editor. At the top of your file, we need to add a title and description: 

```
---
title: "Voidpet: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide!"
description: "For people who are just getting into Voidpet!"
keywords: ["guide"]
---
```

Make sure you don't forget the quotes. 

Next, let's add a heading and some text:

```
## Starting out

Voidpet is a really fun game because:
```

Ok, that looks good, but now I want to add some bullet points. Lets do that:

```
- I loved Pokemon as a kid
- I love ben awad
```

Notice the spacing between the `-` and the list item. 

Now, I'm going to put it all together like so:

```

## Starting out

### Result 

<p className="font-extrabold text-4xl mt-24">Voidpet: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide!</p>
<header className="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-12 max-w-xl mt-4">For people who are just getting into Voidpet!</header>

*Keywords are used for search. Your article will be unsearchable if you don't add them!*

Make sure you space  things  out! Also, preview the file on github. If it doesn't look correct on GitHub, it won't look correct on the website.

## Contributing Guidelines

- All articles must be informative and based on ingame info rather than speculation. While some speculation is ok as the game is in an early stage, make sure it's clear to the reader that the content they're reading is speculation. Purely speculative articles won't be featured and may not be accepted.
- Please make sure you're covering a relevant topic. Many established wikis have pages for almost every topic you could think of, but while we're in this early stage, we don't need an article about a random NPC or item.
- Do **not** edit the main codebase. While you're free to make small edits to the homepage; `index.tsx`, don't mess with any other files that aren't in the `posts` directory. You may add more components as long as they're reusable
